___
## Objective
Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.  
When the user clicks a start button, a timer will start and the user is presented with a question.  When the question is answered, another question is presented.  If the question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer.  The game is over when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.  The user can then save their initials and quiz score.
